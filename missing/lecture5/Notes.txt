Command-line Environment

The shell is using UNIX communication mechanism called a signal to communicate
information to the process. When a process receives a sginal it stops its
execution, deals with the signal and potentially  changes the flow of execution
based on the information that the signal delivered. Signals are *software interrupts*.

`Ctrl-C` delivers a `SIGINT` signal to the process.

`SIGTERM` is a more generic signal asking a process to exit gracefully. We can
do that by: `kill -TERM <PID>`

`SIGSTOP`: pauses a process ~ `Ctrl-Z` will prompt the shell to send a `SIGTSTP`
signal.

We can the continue the paused job in the foreground or in the background
using `fg` or `bg`, respectively.
